# analog-playback-simulator

Analog Playback Simulator (APS)
Simulates analog audio players such as record players, cassette players, 8-track players, reel-to-reel. Realistic model-specific behaviour is the goal of this project. CD players would work too, but then again so would a monkey eating a banana. If you want digital, mash your palm against your phone until music comes out.

Common state elements among analog devices for the purposes of this project are available commands (hotkey and/or image region), audio clip (optional, state or transition), static image display (optional, state-only), animation (optional, state or transition). States and state transitions for each device model will have their own unique variations.

Media organization and selection is outside the scope of this project, playback will be from current directory only.
Console application.

Artwork browsing is undecided, but leaning toward restricting that scope.
