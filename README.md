# analog-playback-simulator
Simulator for analog audio players such as record players, cassette players, 8-track players, reel-to-reel. Realistic model-specific behaviour is the goal of this project.

Common state elements among analog devices for the purposes of this project are an audio clip, static image display (optional), animation (state transitions only), and available commands. States and state transitions for each device model will have their own unique variations.
